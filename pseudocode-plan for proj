//first prompt user to enter in login info
//id and password
//the user will enter in both first

//so we need to check the password the user entered in is valid
//password checker function that gets in a string 
//string comparison
//like check if the string match somehow(like make everything lowercase and compare)

//then we go into the core functions of the program(payment-spot function, function that shows availability)

//for parking lot we need to first initialize all the spots(and make their availability open)

--MAIN:

first do login func

we need to initialize an array of spot objects
int option=0;
do{

cout<<what option do you want to do, 0 is in program, 1 is show parking spots 2 is go in and pay, 3 is exit


}while(option=0);


function that shows availability

--so display all parking lots 

loop through all parking spots and display their attributes
-note: we could ignore the show availability function by doing this
